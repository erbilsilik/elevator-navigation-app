# Elevator Navigation App

## Description

The project designed with **Model-View-Controller** (MVC) pattern. I've used [Fyne](https://developer.fyne.io/) (GUI) library as a view component.

## Running & Using Instructions

`make run`

After deciding which floor you want to go to with a very simple interface, just click on the relevant floor.

Meanwhile, you can watch the console output and make a another request to call the elevator to a different floor while the program is running.
